# Tableau Flight Data Visualization

## Objective:

This project aims to show the seasonal variability in flight delays. Currently the project only visualizes an observable pattern between the change of seasons and the increase/decrease of delayed flights. Future tasks include a full and rigorous statistical analysis confirming the relationship.
